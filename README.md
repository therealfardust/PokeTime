# Pokémon Revolution Online Time Calculator

This is a web-based tool that calculates and displays the current in-game time in Pokémon Revolution Online (PRO), based on real-world time in EST. It also shows the current in-game phase (Morning, Day, Night, or Midnight), the time remaining until Midnight, and the time remaining until the next phase.

**How It Works**

- The in-game time in PRO moves 5 times faster than real time (5 in-game seconds = 1 real second).
- The tool uses an anchor time of 5:00 PM EST, which corresponds to 9:00 AM in-game.
- From this anchor, the script calculates the current in-game time based on your current local time in EST.

**Features**

- Displays current PRO time
- Shows the current phase (Morning, Day, Night, Midnight)
- Shows countdown to Midnight
- Shows countdown to the next phase
- Automatically updates every second

**Usage**

You can run this tool by simply opening the `phasepoke.html` file in your browser. Useful when needing to complete objectives at a certain time.
